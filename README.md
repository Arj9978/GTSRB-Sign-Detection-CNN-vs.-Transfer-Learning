# GTSRB-Sign-Detection-CNN-vs.-Transfer-Learning
Welcome to the GTSRB Sign Detection repository! This project focuses on traffic sign detection using two different approaches: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning with state-of-the-art models VGG19, EfficientNetB7, and NASNetLarge.
