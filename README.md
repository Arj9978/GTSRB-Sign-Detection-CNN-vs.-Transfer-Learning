# GTSRB-Sign-Detection-CNN-vs.-Transfer-Learning
Welcome to the GTSRB Sign Detection repository! This project focuses on traffic sign detection using two different approaches: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning with state-of-the-art models VGG19, EfficientNetB7, and NASNetLarge.

## Introduction
Road safety is paramount, and traffic sign detection plays a crucial role in ensuring safe driving. This repository contains an in-depth analysis and comparison of two popular methods for traffic sign detection: traditional CNN-based models and Transfer Learning using pre-trained VGG19, EfficientNetB7, and NASNetLarge models.

## Dataset
The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset is used for training and evaluation. It is a widely used dataset in computer vision, containing images of various traffic signs and corresponding labels.

## Code and Notebooks
The code for both approaches, CNN-based models and Transfer Learning, is available in this repository. You can find Jupyter notebooks showcasing step-by-step implementations and explanations for each model. The code is written in Python, utilizing popular libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.

## Model Architectures
1. CNN-based models: We explore the design and implementation of traditional CNN architectures for traffic sign detection. Different configurations are tested to find the best-performing CNN model.

2. Transfer Learning: Leveraging the power of transfer learning, we fine-tune pre-trained VGG19, EfficientNetB7, and NASNetLarge models on the GTSRB dataset. The advantages and challenges of transfer learning for traffic sign detection are discussed.

## Evaluation and Comparison
The performance of each model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to ensure unbiased results. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to compare the models' effectiveness.

## Results and Insights
In addition to the model comparison, this repository offers insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach. Visualizations and analysis of misclassified samples provide valuable information for further improvements.

## How to Contribute
Contributions to this project are highly appreciated. If you have ideas for model enhancements, data preprocessing techniques, or any other improvements, feel free to submit pull requests. Let's collaborate to make traffic sign detection more efficient and accurate!
